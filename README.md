Record and Upload Audio with Stop on Silence

run: https://webrec.replit.app

dev: https://replit.com/@jsalsman/webrec

# To Do
- Get microphone permission and start level meter on page load
  - not sure if Safari allows permission request without a gesture/click
- Look into https://www.vad.ricky0123.com/docs/browser as a Hark.js replacement
  - API docs are lengthy, as is loading time, but performance is superb
  - https://github.com/ricky0123/vad has a discord server
