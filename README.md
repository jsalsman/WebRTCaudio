Records Audio with Stop on Silence

# ToDo
- Get microphone permission and start level meter on page load
-- not sure if Safari allows permission request without a gesture/click
- Look into https://www.vad.ricky0123.com/docs/browser as a Hark.js replacement
-- API docs are lengthy, as is loading time, but performance is superb
-- https://github.com/ricky0123/vad has a discord server
